|Sal -dApp| This decentralized application solves the problem of multiple hands involved in the simple task of paying employees. In startups/companies we see that a specific team is involved to manage salaries of employees that can simply be done by a single person. So using this application we allow a single person/admin to pay all of their employees at once on basis of the position they are working on. This would save a lot of resources for a startup/company as the task done by a team can now be done by a single person.|Not done | |

| Decentralised-Swap| Centralized exchanges require the user to verify themselves and the transaction between any two buyers and sellers involves an intermediary. Decentralised-Swap is a decentralized exchange over ethereum wherein the transaction takes place directly between the buyer and seller. This removes the intermediary and the KYC requirement which otherwise would need to be done in centralized exchanges. This is one of the core concepts of decentralization, which states trustless transactions. Decentralised-Swap is a simple user friendly DApp built using Solidity for smart contracts| Not done | |

| E-Voting using blockchain | Digital voting is the use of electronic devices, such as votingmachines or an internet browser, to cast votes. These are sometimes referred to as e-voting whenvoting using a machine in a polling station, and e-voting when using a web browser.Security of digital voting is always the biggest concern when considering to implement a digitalvoting system. With such monumental decisions at stake, there can be no doubt about thesystem’s ability to secure data and defend against potential.| Not done | | 
|To-Do-List |A to-do list where adding a new item or task means wrapping and adding it to the blockchain. Plan your app’s web architecture so that the logic is written in Ethereum smart contracts and the front-end interacts with the blockchain instead of the usual web back-end and database. Expand your smart contract so that it can add new tasks, modify them, delete them, mark them complete, set deadlines for them, and do other actions involved with creating a to-do list.| Not done | |
|Making Cryptocurrencies Spendable - SpendX | The biggest issue with cryptocurrencies since their early days has been that of adoption. Finding merchants that directly accept cryptocurrencies can be hard even in some of the larger cities in the world, so most cryptocurrency enthusiasts end up only holding the digital asset. But the SpendX card can bring cryptocurrencies tothe mainstream society by opening up the millions of point of sale systems already in place across the world.| Not done| |
| Exchange Services Platform | Decentralized exchanges are slowly growing in popularity as they provide a seamless user trade experience without worrying about any hacks or transparency. This also means that there is no centralized authority and no conflict of interest from the owner’s side. They mainly use many decentralized finance applications to streamline their services. As we already know that the Web 3.0 depends on trust, it is all about decentralized exchange.| Not done||
| Browser | We explore the Web through the web browser. For browsing the web 3.0, we need a browser that fits the decentralized Web’s philosophical aspect. Also, the current-gen browsers are not completely secure when it comes to protecting users.When users go into infected websites, their computers can get infected. Browsers also leak information if they are not well developed according to current security standards. For example, your browser stores your location, hardware and software information, connection information, social media information, and so on. The users are also vulnerable through the add-ons that these modern browsers have to offer. The solution is to use a decentralized browser that provides a better ecosystem using blockchain technology.|Not done||
| Land Registries System | We have observed around us a lot of cases where someone claims another’s land, transaction frauds occur, documents are lost, and many more such issues. Blockchain will help us in solving all these issues and also will maintain the records of the transactions leading to quick and safe retrieval of data. So blockchain-based system which resolves all the land issues.|Not done| |
| Genuine Charity Applications | In these recent times, people are really interested in helping and giving back to the community, but they feel that will this help really reach the needy people? So in such cases, we can make a transparent and genuine charity application that will prove helpful to the community.The needy people would upload their data on the portal connected to the Blockchain system .The community can access their data from the Blockchain and would be able to help them directly and safely.| Not done||
| Document storage systems |There are a lot of documents and licenses which are really very important for us, and we can be needing them any time. So we can build a secure platform with the help of blockchain which can ensure that our documents are safe and easy to access.The user will upload their documents to the Blockchain system.The government or any system which requires submission of documents can access them from the Blockchain with the required permissions from the user.This system if implemented would lead to secure, paperless, and quick transactions and would be convenient to the users as well as the government.| Not done||
| Crowdfunding | Blockchain-powered crowdfunding is anonymous, safe, and borderless, it has the potential to be more democratic. Blockchain can help to speed up the development of a worldwide crowdfunding platform that anybody in the world may use. It will enable all-encompassing crowdfunding. Instead of giving money to a comapny or a third party , with the help of smart contract the people will be able to directly give money to the people who are asking for funds.
| Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange|A Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is a digital currency exchange. It allows buying cryptocurrency through direct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions due to a secure internet platform without intermediaries. DEX gives the blockchain or distributed ledger the opportunity to take the place of a third party. By bringing critical operations to the blockchain, the underlying cryptocurrency technology excludes single points of failure, allows customers to retain control of their assets, and enables safer and more transparent trading. DEX uses smart contracts to execute market transactions by distributing transactions to autonomous code, but there are several options for order fulfillment with varying degrees of decentralization.| Not done||
| Time lock Wallet |The first project idea in this category is – Time lock Smart Contract. A time lock smart contract would be a wallet that would keep your crypto assets locked for a certain amount of time. That means you won’t be able to withdraw your crypto assets even if you want to do so. We can use such wallets for multiple reasons. But one of the biggest applications of this time lock wallet is to prevent you from selling your crypto assets on the crash of the market. When the market crashes people tend to sell their crypto due to the fear of losing all their invested money. But we all know that if we want to make some really high profit in crypto we need to be able to hold it for a very long time. One way of doing this is to lock your crypto in a time lock wallet.| Not done||
|Savings and Lending Application |Using this application, people would be able to take loans on the blockchains. That means they can essentially lock up certain assets and borrow other cryptocurrencies and then pay back later after a certain amount of time.The smart contract will have all the business logic to manage the saving and lending protocols. Traders can lock up certain cryptocurrency assets to borrow a different kind of asset, then trade it and make a profit.| Not done||
| Nft- Staking dapp | NFT staking refers to locking up non-fungible tokens on a platform or protocol in exchange for staking rewards and other benefits.
