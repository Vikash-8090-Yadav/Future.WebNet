At the moment, Ethereum is the most commonly used blockchain for developers, investors, and traders. The growing popularity of decentralized services and applications has given Ethereum a considerable boost in terms of usage, with tens of thousands of individuals interacting with the network daily.

However, as time passes, the Ethereum ecosystem is beginning to exhibit flaws, which has made room for purported "Ethereum killers."
Even though Ethereum plans to solve its shortcomings through several upgrades, the upgrades' implementation is not completed yet. Ethereum killers have capitalized on this delay, appealing to crypto users with faster transactions and cheaper fees.

This article covers; what Ethereum killers are, why they are termed so, and some examples.

## What are Ethereum killers?
Ethereum killers are alternative open-source blockchains that seek to solve Ethereum's current shortcomings, like exorbitantly high gas fees and the low number of transactions on the blockchain, hence "killing" its popularity or prevalence in the industry. 

For the time being, the leading players against Ethereum are Cardano, EOS, Solana, BNB, and Polkadot.

## Top Ethereum killers and Why are they so?

## Cardano
Cardano was launched in 2017, and since then, it has been popularly recognized as one of the most popular and hyped Ethereum killers. 

Cardano began as a public, open-source, decentralized ecosystem, but with the 'Alonzo' upgrade, Cardano has more programmability by allowing it to support NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and a wide range of smart contracts.

### What makes it an Ethereum killer?
- Cardano's cryptocurrency token, ADA, is based on a more deflationary principle, which means a fixed coin supply. Regardless of how things go for this ecosystem, demand will eventually increase.

- Cardano uses the Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol, which makes the network more energy-efficient and eco-friendly.

- Cardano outperforms Ethereum in network throughput, which can support up to 266 transactions per second(TPS), compared to 13 TPS for Ethereum. Cardano is steadily advancing along its technology roadmap and improving the performance of its network.

- Cardano operates in a highly open-source environment, and it is often regarded as the blockchain that offers the highest level of support to smart contracts and decentralized applications. 

## Solana
Solana is among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap and was introduced in 2020. Solana is currently the second most dominant blockchain in the NFT sector, with its native SOL token reaching an all-time high- of $221 as of 2021. 
Solana is considered one of the rivals to Ethereum due to some reasons:

### What makes it an Ethereum killer?
- Solana is a smart contract platform that promises high speeds, a scalable ecosystem, and low transaction costs.

- Instead of relying on just one protocol for consensus, Solana employs two: a Proof-of-History (PoH) algorithm and the second known as a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. 

- Solana can maintain a faster throughput of transactions at 65,000 transactions per second and an average block time of 600 milliseconds. It is 2000 times faster than Ethereum's rate.


## Polkadot
Polkadot was founded in 2020 by Gavin Wood, Robert Habermeier, and Petter Czaban. It had a market cap of $11.01 billion at the time of this writing.
DOT, the native currency of Polkadot, is currently ranked 8th on the list of world crypto players.

### What makes it an Ethereum killer?

- Polkadot addresses the issue of scalability and inter-chain operability with its use of parachains. Parachains enable networks to process multi-parallelized transactions, empowering the network to achieve 1 million TPS.

- Polkadot is forkless and cannot be splintered, meaning it doesn't accept a hard fork to make updates or introduce new features. 

- The Polkadot platform also uses the nominated proof of stake (NPoS) protocol, which involves choosing a fewer number of validators to verify a block, therefore bringing down the energy requirements for the validation process.

- With Polkadot, developers can construct far more than just dApps; instead, they can design complete blockchains that are suited to the requirements of their applications while utilizing the security of the main Polkadot chain. "Shared security" is the term used by Polkadot.

## Binance Smart Chain
Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is the blockchain launched by the biggest centralized crypto exchange, Binance, in 2019.

The BSC blockchain network was created to be cross-chain compatible with the native Binance Chain, creating high-performance decentralized applications (dApps) and other applications based on smart contracts.

BNB, Binance's native cryptocurrency, is ranked as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency.

### What makes it an Ethereum killer?

- BSC intends to allow traders and investors to manage their digital assets with low latency and cost, offering a robust toolkit for dApp creation. In doing so, it effectively addresses two of Ethereum's most significant drawbacks.

- BSC supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which also supports Ethereum-based apps to run on the blockchain.

- Binance often executes coin burns, increasing BNB's value over time.

- Transactions on Binance are cheaper and faster. BSC is the less expensive option when it comes to transaction fees because it charges an average of 7 gwei for each transaction, with one gwei being worth 0.000000001 BNB, or just $0.0003, or a tiny fraction of a cent.

- The network is roughly three times faster than Ethereum, with an average block time of 3.0 seconds and a 39.2 TPS.


## Will Any Blockchain Really "Kill" Ethereum?
Many blockchains have the potential to surpass Ethereum, but doing so would require significant effort.

As of now, Ethereum is by far the best blockchain for creating decentralized projects. 
Due to its broad use and first-mover advantage, the Ethereum network continues to lead the smart contract market. Even Binance's BNB, Ether's closest rival, would need to grow its value by 11 times to overtake it as the second-largest cryptocurrency.

When considering the total value locked (TVL) in the DeFi market, Ethereum's dominance is clearly seen. Currently, Ethereum accounts for US$77.2 billion, or more than 75% of the TVL, of the total net, valued locked, which is US$103.6 billion. With $17.9 billion secured on its chain, Binance Smart Chain comes in second to Ethereum and accounts for around 17% of the TVL in DeFi.

Also, With the merge so far completed, Ethereum's grasp of the DeFI and smart contract market is not likely to loosen.

Following the ideas of real decentralization, the future of decentralized finance is likely built on multiple robust networks rather than a single dominant entity.
With the DeFi industry growing 88x in a single year, there's room for blockchain platforms to rather coexist and contribute to the future of Web 3.0 together. 

## Conclusion
Ethereum killers are mostly open-source blockchains that aim to solve some significant problems that the main Ethereum network is yet to solve.
However, these Ethereum killers haven't overtaken the Ethereum blockchain yet.

Ethereum is also putting every effort into offering solutions to its current downsides.
