## Description

In this website a user can buy the registered domain name by giving certain amount of money and after the user buys the domain they will be given a NFT having the name of the domain on it, which they can view directly on opensea testnet. The user can also check their transaction hash, and view the transaction.

## Problem it solves

In general web2.0, if the organization is not trusted they can sell the same domain name to a number of user, and the user canot have any proof that this domain belongs them . In our decentralized application, after the domain name is bought their transaction is registered in the blockchain and also an NFT is provided as the proof.
