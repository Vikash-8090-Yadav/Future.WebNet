##What is an API?
API(application programming interface) is a is a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other.
It acts as an intermediate  layer that processes data transfers between systems, letting companies open their application data and functionality to external
third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies.

### How an API works?

Let's take an exmaple of third party e-commerce site to understand this concept. 
- When the buyer clicks the payment button, an API calls to retrieve informationâ€”also known as a request. This request is processed from an application to the web server.
 
- After receiving a valid request from the product webpage, the API makes a call to the external program or web server( in this case, the third-party payment system).
 
-The server sends a response to the API with the requested information.
 
-The API transfers the data to the initial requesting application( here the product website).

You can also understand this concept  by taking an example of a servant in restaurant , as servants acts as an intermediate between customers and the chef just like that API's send 
request to web server and then according to the request another web server responds.

###API benefits
APIs simplify helps in design and development of new applications , services and integration or management of existing ones.
